## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

Not Applicable. I did it on my own.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

The only challenge I faced is with the sounds. It was not at first sounding in my browser. But I realized that I was making a
mistake in the js function after 20 mins staring at it lol.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

The question that I first had ws what if I make a website that is all about sounds and animations when scrolling the website.
I realized that it could be fun instead of having that websites that you keep scrolling and reading things. Having the option
of listen instead of reading would be a great thing to add in web dev, then I was like why haven't people already done that?
Cause I know people have crazy ideas and probably someone outhere thought of it. I am now curious of how to make that happen
and will definitely try that out.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

I would probably work on adding sounds that are very customized. For instance when the user clicked on a button it will make
a melodie that is realted to some of the topics that he will choose before starting the game. I would also add a small animation
when the button are clicked and probably have some characters that pops up as well dancing on the melodie. I believe in the power
of technology and I am sure few more hours would help me come up with a logic that will help me implement those features by the refactoring
and enhancing the existing functions.
